1. Run aiken check, if errors update to latest version of aiken using aikup. 
    a. May need to run aikup directly as PATH may be screwy, in /config/.aiken/bin/aikup
    b. May need to mv old version of aiken out of /usr/local/bin/aiken

2. Once aiken check is working, write validators as desired

3. aiken build [-t verbose] # to keep traces

4. create addresses as per /scripts

5. parameterize-validator.sh

6. deploy-contract.sh
